you can download dialogs testing hack from:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
http://0xAF.org/400d_dialogs.tar.gz
THE FIRMWARE ON THE ABOVE URL IS ONLY FOR DEVS WILLING TO SEE THE DIALOGS !!!
IT'S NOT HARMFUL, BUT IT'S BROKEN BY DESIGN... DO NOT USE IT !!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
if for some reason you can't get the file, drop me a mail on firedust@gmail

buttons in use:
DP = activate dialogs test (start)
DIAL LEFT/RIGHT = prev/next dialog
up/down = param1 inc/dec
left/right = param2 dec/inc

so far i cannot see any use of the params ...

almost every dialog will have some strings
the strings are 4 numbers in format "D,L,P1,P2"
where:
D = current dialog number (template)
L = current line  - which is set by sub_FF837FA8()
P1,P2 = param1,param2 value


see start_dialogs_test() in menu_experimental.c
to see how to create dialog and set the lines.

(a new way of creating dialogs has been suggested by Sergei,
i should look at it any moment now, so it could be different
in the future. still you can get the impression of how to use them)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
here are the template ids which in my opinion are usable:

error screens:
	usable: 4
	maybe:

info screens:
	usable: 24,52,79,94
	maybe: 14,28,33,46,90

confirmation screens:
	usable: 21,37,40,53,71,95
	maybe: 34,39

menus/interactive:
	usable: 8,9,10,22,25,26,42,47,50,69,70,74
	maybe: 18,54

on screen dialogs:
	usable: 5,13,64,98,101,103,108
	maybe: 6


79 can be used for counting the scripts
