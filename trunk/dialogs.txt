hope this info helps... i'll try to make experimental menu
where the dialogs can be seen, but so far we cannot use the
menu structure to show all dialogs. to switch the dialogs
i need to get in message_proxy and the code is dirty,
i cannot add it to the repository ATM.

here are the template ids which are usable:

error screens:
	usable: 4
	maybe:

info screens:
	usable: 24,52,79,94
	maybe: 14,28,33,46,90

confirmation screens:
	usable: 21,37,40,53,71,95
	maybe: 34,39

menus/interactive:
	usable: 8,9,10,22,25,26,42,47,50,69,70,74
	maybe: 18,54

on screen dialogs:
	usable: 5,13,64,98,101,103,108
	maybe: 6


79 can be used for counting the scripts
