### Some notes (**0xAF**) ###
> I've tried to narrow down the all ppl who worked on this hack from the beginning,
> if i've missed someone, please let me know.

> This hack was developed by many ppl from it's very beginning,
> and it was developed in separate versions...

> I guess this is the way the hard-core hackers are working (mostly alone),
> but I'm so grateful that Eduperez rewrited the code from the scratch.

> He made it easier for new developers to join the project and we have
> one hack in the end !
