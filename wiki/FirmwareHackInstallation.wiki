  #. use a fully charged battery. you need CF card reader and windows, linux  or mac.<br>on a mac you can use the native method or, use windows under bootcamp/vmware fusion or use the linux method.
  #. update to [http://web.canon.jp/imaging/eosdigital3/e4kr3_firmware-e.html latest firmware (1.1.1)] by copying it into the root of CF with your card reader,<br> then put it in the camera and run "update firmware" in the setup menu.
  #. empty your CF, download [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/downloads/list testfir.fir] and copy it into the root of your CF with the card reader.
  #. insert CF into the camera and run firmware update using testfir.fir, the screen will go blank.<br> _*<font color="red">wait at least 2 minutes</font>*_, turn off, take battery out and back in.
  #. this step depends on your OS and CF Card, but first insert CF into the camera and format it.<br>_,,you can format it on the PC too,,_
    * Windows: use [http://pel.hu/down/EOScard.exe EOScard] by [http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=4214.msg58253#msg58253 pelican], you need to check EOS_DEVELOP and BOOTDISK<br>like shown [http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/EOScard here] <br>_,,note: There were user with Win7 and no method was working, so eventually he installed VirtualBox with Linux LiveCD running on it and used the linux method, after attaching the card reader to the VM.,,_
    * Mac: use zeno's [http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/macboot/macboot.html MacBoot] automated tool.
    * Linux: use the direct method (below)<br>or use the method and files described [http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/1161d4e6e93232de here] (use the second version)
    * Direct method for Linux, Mac and windows with [http://www.cygwin.com/ cygwin] or [http://www.chrysocome.net/dd dd]:
      * FAT12/FAT16 (CF Card <= 4GB)
{{{
dev=/dev/sdb1 # replace sdb1 with your CF device (first partition)
echo EOS_DEVELOP | dd of="$dev" bs=1 seek=43 count=11
echo BOOTDISK | dd of="$dev" bs=1 seek=64 count=8
}}}
      * FAT32
{{{
dev=/dev/sdb1 # replace sdb1 with your CF device (first partition)
echo EOS_DEVELOP | dd of="$dev" bs=1 seek=71 count=11
echo BOOTDISK | dd of="$dev" bs=1 seek=92 count=8
}}}
      * exFAT
        this is not going to work directly, because the sector checksums needs to be<br> calculated and written back after writing the strings. use the above methods.
  #. download the [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/downloads/list latest autoexec.bin], extract and copy to CF. 
  #. put the languages.ini on the CF too if you want additional languages.
  #. insert the CF into camera and you are done.
