#summary A Word of Warning

= Introduction =

It is the users responsibility to read this warning, and fully understand the experimental nature of this hack before using it.

= Details =

It is unlikely, but theoretically possible, to damage your camera by means of using this hack. 400plus is created by reverse engineering an undocumented system that directly controls hardware. Because of this, it is impossible to be certain that it is completely safe. There have been no confirmed cases of 400plus damaging a camera, but in some cases it would be very difficult to distinguish between coincidental failures and failures caused in part by 400plus.

= Summary =

400plus comes with no warranty for any use; you use it at your own risk.
