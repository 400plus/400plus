= Introduction =

This guide should give some lights on how to translate the 400plus project to your language.


= Details =

First you need to download languages.ini file from the [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/downloads/list NightlyBuild] or directly from the  [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/source/browse/trunk/languages.ini trunk]

Then you will have to take the key/value pairs from  [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/source/browse/trunk/languages.h languages.h] file

They look like this:
{{{
LANG_PAIR( FREE_SPACE,         "Free Space"         ) \
LANG_PAIR( RELEASE_COUNT,      "ReleaseCount"       ) \
LANG_PAIR( OFF,                "Off"                ) \
LANG_PAIR( YES,                "Yes"                ) \
LANG_PAIR( NO,                 "No"                 ) \
LANG_PAIR( 2S,                 "2s"                 ) \
}}}

Here the first parameter of LANG_PAIR is the key and the second is value.

for example:
{{{
FREE_SPACE = key
"Free Space" = value
}}}

After translating the values, you will need to put all the keys and the translated values in the languages.ini file in the appropriate section.

here is an example of German language section:
{{{
[GERMAN]
FREE_SPACE         = CF-Card frei
RELEASE_COUNT      = Anz. d. Aufn.
OFF                = Aus
YES                = Ja
NO                 = Nein
}}}

After you're ready with the new languages.ini file, open a new [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/issues/list issue], and attach the file there.
