= Introduction =

This guide should give some lights on how to translate the `400plus` project to your language.

= Details =

First you need to download `languages.ini` file from the [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/downloads/list NightlyBuild] or directly from the [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/source/browse/trunk/languages.ini trunk]. Then you will have to take the key/value pairs from  [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/source/browse/trunk/languages.h languages.h] file. They look like this:

{{{
LANG_PAIR( FREE_SPACE,         "Free Space"         ) \
LANG_PAIR( RELEASE_COUNT,      "ReleaseCount"       ) \
LANG_PAIR( OFF,                "Off"                ) \
LANG_PAIR( YES,                "Yes"                ) \
LANG_PAIR( NO,                 "No"                 ) \
LANG_PAIR( 2S,                 "2s"                 ) \
}}}

Here the first parameter of `LANG_PAIR` is the key and the second is value; for example:

{{{
FREE_SPACE = key
"Free Space" = value
}}}

After translating the values, you will need to put all the keys and the translated values in the `languages.ini` file in the appropriate section; here is an example of German language section:

{{{
[GERMAN]
FREE_SPACE         = CF-Card frei
RELEASE_COUNT      = Anz. d. Aufn.
OFF                = Aus
YES                = Ja
NO                 = Nein
}}}

_NOTE: Please, do not use MS-Window's Notepad for this, as it may add hidden characters or change the file format, and render it unusable; a good free editor is [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ Notepad++]._

After you're ready with the new `languages.ini` file, you will have to test it with the last [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/downloads/list NightlyBuild] and test whether it's working: just copy your new `languages.ini` to the CF card where you installed `400plus`, and see how the translations look like.

If everything runs smoothly, open a new [http://code.google.com/p/400plus/issues/list issue], and attach the file there.
