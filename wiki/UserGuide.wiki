#summary User Guide for 400plus

= Introduction =

This document contains the user guide for 400plus. It is supposed in this document that the user has installed 400plus and it is working properly, prior to reading this guide. For information about installing 400plus, please see FirmwareHackInstallation.

= The menu =

== Accessing the menu ==

To enter the menu, press `MENU` (this will display the camera menu) and then `DISP.` (this will display the "camera settings" screen); on the last row of that screen, where the card capacity should de displayed, is the menu.

== Navigating the menu ==

Initially, the menu will display the number of shots made by this camera ("Release count"). To navigate the menu, use the `UP` (`ISO`) and `DOWN` (`WB`) buttons to move to other item; then use the `LEFT` (`METERING MODE`) and `RIGHT` (`AF MODE`) buttons to change the value of the current item. Press and hold these buttons to move faster.

On some items, the `AV` button can be used to roll the value.

Use the `SET` button to save the values and activate the changes; *notice* that all changes will be lost if you exit the menu before pressing the `SET` button.

== Navigating the sub-menus ==

Sub-menus are displayed as "Ext. AEB>Frames", where "Ext. AEB" is the item and "Frames" is the sub-item. Use the `AV` key to roll to the next sub-item, then `LEFT` and `RIGHT` to change the value. `UP` and `DOWN` can be used anytime to move to another item.

== The items ==

 * _*Release count*_: Displays the total number of shots made by this camera, in its entire lifetime (_this is a read-only value_).
 * _*Av comp*_: Same as the _standard_ "AV compensation", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*Flash comp*_: Same as the _standard_ "Flash compensation", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*AEB*_: Same as the _standard_ "AEB", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*Safety shift*_: When active, and if in `Tv` (resp. `Av`) mode, the camera will change the shutter speed (resp. diaphragm aperture) set by the user to avoid a under/over-exposure, if the value is too small/large for the scene.
 * _*ISO in viewfinder*_: When active, and if in `P` or `Tv` mode, use the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` buttons to change the ISO while looking through the viewfinder.
 * _*WB*_: Use the `AV` button to roll over the _standard_ values; then move to the "Temp. K" sub-item to set a user-defined color temperature (use `LEFT` / `RIGHT` to change the value).
 * _*Flash*_: Force the deactivation of the flash (during the shot), even if it has been raised.
 * _*AF assist beam*_: Force the deactivation of the flash (during the AF phase), even if it has been raised.
 * _*DP Button*_: Select the action to be performed when the `DIRECT PRINT` button is pressed in a _creative mode_:
    * Disabled: do nothing.
    * Wave: start the [UserGuide#Hand_Wave Hand Wave] script.
    * Ext AEB: start the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script.
    * Interval: start the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] script.
    * Intm ISO: roll to an intermediate ISO (100 => 125 => 160 => 100, for example) (see [UserGuide#Extended_ISOs Notes / Extended ISOs]).
    * Timer: start the [UserGuide#Self_Timer Self Timer] script.
 * _*Wave*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Hand_Wave Hand Wave] script:
    * Delay: select wether this script should take the shot immediately, or wait for 2 seconds.
    * Action: action to be performed.
 * _*Ext. AEB*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script:
    * Frames: number of frames to shot.
    * Step (EV): separation in EV between shots.
    * Delay: select wether this script should start shooting immediately or wait 2 seconds.
    * Manual [: minimum shutter speed in `M` mode.
    * Manual ]: maximum shutter speed in `M` mode.
 * _*Interval*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] script:
    * Delay: select wether this script should start shooting immediately, or wait for 2 seconds.
    * Time (s): time (in seconds) between each shot.
    * EAEB: select wether [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] should be used on each shot.
    * Shots: number of sots to make, or select "no limit" to shot endlessly;
 * _*Timer*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Self_Timer Self Timer] script:
    * Delay (s): time (in seconds) that the script should wait before shooting.
    * Action: action to be performed.
 * _*IR remote delay*_: Select wether the camera should wait 2 seconds when released using an IR remote.

= The scripts =

All scripts are activated with the `DIRECT PRINT` menu, and which one of them is run must be selected at the "DP Button" menu item. When a script starts or stops, a beep will be heard; and while a script is running, the `DIRECT PRINT` button will flash (twice per second, aprox.). To stop a running script, simply put your hand on the back of the camera, over the "display-off sensor": the display will go blank and the script will stop as soon as possible.

== Extended AEB ==

This scripts performs the same task than the _standard_ AEB option from the camera, with some differences:
 # Up to 9 shots can be specified.
 # The separation between shots can be configured up to +6 EV.
 # The camera will take all the shots in a sequence, automatically.

In `M` mode, this script will shoot the camera as many times as needed, with shutter speeds ranging from "Manual [" to "Manual ]", and separating each shot according to the "Step (EV)" value.

== Intervalometer ==

This script will fire the camera as many times as configured (or endlessly), waiting the specified time between shots; use this script to create _stop-motion_ movies, for example. Set "EAEB" to "yes" to run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script on each shot.

== Hand Wave ==

This script will fire the camera when the "display-off sensor" is triggered; use this script to shot the camera without a remote. Can run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] or the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] scripts, if configured at the "Action" sub-item.

== Self Timer ==

This script simply adds a configurable pause before shooting the camera; can run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] or the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] scripts, if configured at the "Action" sub-item.

= The AF-Pattern selection =

Press the `ZOOM IN` button to enter the _standard_ "AF-Point selection" dialog; then press `ZOOM IN` again to enter the new "AF-Pattern selection" dialog. Use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `SET` buttons to move around the patterns, then half-press the shutter button to exit the dialog.

= The shortcuts =

The following _shortcuts_ have been added to the camera.

== In the basic zone ==

In the _basic zone_, only the `DIRECT PRINT` button has a special use: use it to toggle between `RAW` and `JPEG` output.

== In the creative zone ==

In the _creative zone_ the following shortcuts are active:
 * In the ISO selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set ISO 3200 (see [UserGuide#Extended_ISOs Notes / Extended ISOs]).
 * In the metering mode selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set spot metering (see [UserGuide#Spot_metering_mode Notes / Spot metering mode]).
 * In the white balance selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set the user-defined color temperature.

= Other freebies =

Other changes to the camera behavior, not described above.

== The nose affair ==

While looking through the viewfinder, the `ISO` and `WB` buttons are no longer active, to prevent accidental changes with the user's nose.

= Notes =

Some notes and comments.

== Extended ISOs ==

_Non-standard_ ISO values are software-only, and technically produce zero gain over shooting at the _base_ ISO and later post-processing the image; this include ISO-3200.

== Spot metering mode ==

The spot metering mode is like the _standard_ "partial metering" mode, but the area included in the metering is smaller.
