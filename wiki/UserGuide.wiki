= Introduction =

This document contains the user guide for 400plus. It is supposed in this document that the user has installed 400plus and it is working properly, prior to reading this guide. For information about installing 400plus, please see [FirmwareHackInstallation].

= The menu =

== Accessing the menu ==

To enter the 400plus menu, press `MENU` (this will display the _standard_ camera menu) and then `DIRECT PRINT` (this will display the new 400plus menu). To exit the 400plus menu, just half-press the shutter button.

== Navigating the menu ==

To navigate the menu, use the `UP` (`ISO`) and `DOWN` (`WB`) buttons to move among items. Then use the `LEFT` (`METERING MODE`) and `RIGHT` (`AF MODE`) buttons to change the value of the current item; press and hold these buttons to change faster. On some items, the `AV` button can be used to roll the value.

Use the `SET` button to save the values and activate the changes; please, *notice* that all changes will be lost if you exit the menu before pressing the `SET` button.

== Navigating the sub-menus ==

Sub-menus are displayed as "`ITEM>SUBITEM`"; use the front dial to roll to the next subitem, then `LEFT` and `RIGHT` to change the value (press and hold to change faster). Both `UP` and `DOWN` can be used anytime to move to another item.

== The items ==

 * _*Av comp*_: Same as the _standard_ "AV compensation", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*Flash comp*_: Same as the _standard_ "Flash compensation", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*AEB*_: Same as the _standard_ "AEB", but may go from -6 to +6 EV.
 * _*ISO in viewfinder*_: When active, and if in `P` or `Tv` mode, use the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` buttons to change the ISO while looking through the viewfinder.
 * _*Shortcuts menu*_: When active, the shortcuts menu will be displayed from the main dialog when pressing the `DIRECT PRINT` button; when set to "No", the `DIRECT PRINT` button will change to an intermediate ISO.
 * _*Safety shift*_: When active, and if in `Tv` (resp. `Av`) mode, the camera will change the shutter speed (resp. diaphragm aperture) set by the user to avoid a under/over-exposure, if the value is too small/large for the scene.
 * _*Color Temp. (K)*_: Set a user-defined color temperature (activate it later pressing `DIRECT PRINT` at the white balance selection dialog).
 * _*Flash*_: Force the deactivation of the flash (during the shot), even if it has been raised.
 * _*Handwave*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Hand_Waving Hand Waving] script:
    * Delay: select whether this script should take the shot immediately, or wait for 2 seconds.
    * Action: action to be performed.
    * Repeat: if selected, the script will restart itself after each shot, so you can wave your hand again to take another shot.
    * Instant: if selected, the script shot as soon as a hand is detected; otherwise, the script will wait until the hand is removed.
 * _*Ext. AEB*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script:
    * Frames: number of frames to shot.
    * Step (EV): separation in EV between shots.
    * Delay: select whether this script should start shooting immediately or wait 2 seconds.
    * Manual [: minimum shutter speed in `M` mode.
    * Manual ]: maximum shutter speed in `M` mode.
 * _*Interval*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] script:
    * Delay: select whether this script should start shooting immediately, or wait for 2 seconds.
    * Time (s): time (in seconds) between each shot.
    * EAEB: select whether [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] should be used on each shot.
    * Shots: number of sots to make, or select "no limit" to shot endlessly;
 * _*Timer*_: This sub-menu configures the [UserGuide#Self_Timer Self Timer] script:
    * Delay (s): time (in seconds) that the script should wait before shooting.
    * Action: action to be performed.
 * _*IR remote delay*_: Select whether the camera should wait 2 seconds when released using an IR remote.
 * _*Developers menu*_: Press `SET` while this entry is highlighted to enter the [UserGuide#Developers_Menu developers menu].

= The shortcuts menu =

To access the shortcuts menu, just press the `DIRECT PRINT` button from the main dialog (unless the "Shortcuts menu" option is off at the settings menu, obviously); navigate this menu like a normal menu, and press `SET` to apply a change or launch and script:

 * _*Intermediate ISO*_: Roll through the intermediate ISOs.
 * _*Extended AEB*_: Start the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script.
 * _*Intervalometer*_: Start the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] script.
 * _*Hand waving*_: Start the [UserGuide#Hand_Waving Hand Waving] script.
 * _*Self timer*_: Start the [UserGuide#Self_Timer Self Timer] button.
 * _*AF assist beam*_: Force the deactivation of the flash (during the AF phase), even if it has been raised.
 * _*Mirror lock-up*_: Enable / disable the "mirror lock-up" custom function.
 * _*Rear curtain flash*_: Enable / disable the "sync flash to the second curtain" custom function.

To exit the shortcuts menu, half-press the shutter button.

== Configuring the shortcuts menu ==

While in the shortcuts menu, pres `MENU` to "grab" and item (a small ">" will be displayed at the left of the item); then use `UP` / `DOWN` to place it, and press `MENU` again when done. Do not forget to press `SET` to save the new shortcuts order to the card before leaving.

= The scripts =

All scripts are activated from the [UserGuide#The_Shortcuts_Menu Shortcuts Menu]. When a script starts or stops, a _beep_ will be heard; and while a script is running, the `DIRECT PRINT` button will flash (twice per second, approx.).

To stop a running script, press the `DIRECT PRINT` button again; sometimes the camera may not stop immediately, so press and hold the `DIRECT PRINT` button until you hear a _beep_ that signals the effective end of the script.

== Extended AEB ==

This scripts performs the same task than the _standard_ AEB option from the camera, with some differences:
 # Up to 9 shots can be specified.
 # The separation between shots can be configured up to +6 EV.
 # The camera will take all the shots in a sequence, automatically.

In `M` mode, this script will shoot the camera as many times as needed, with shutter speeds ranging from "Manual [" to "Manual ]", and separating each shot according to the "Step (EV)" value.

== Intervalometer ==

This script will fire the camera as many times as configured (or endlessly), waiting the specified time between shots; use this script to create _stop-motion_ movies, for example. Set "EAEB" to "yes" to run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script on each shot.

== Hand Waving ==

This script will fire the camera when the "display-off sensor" at the back of the camera is triggered; use this script to shot the camera without a remote. Can run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] or the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] scripts, if configured at the "Action" sub-item. If the "Repeat" option is active, this script will not end after being triggered, but will repeat itself again so you can take more shots. By default, the script will wait until a hand blocks the sensor and then is removed; but, when the "Instant" option is active, the script will fire the camera as soon as a hand blocks the sensor.

== Self Timer ==

This script simply adds a configurable pause before shooting the camera; can run the [UserGuide#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] or the [UserGuide#Intervalometer Intervalometer] scripts, if configured at the "Action" sub-item.

= The presets =

*WARNING*: This presets feature is still experimental, use with care.

A "preset" is a complete snapshot containing all the settings and configuration parameters from the camera. Presets can be used to preconfigure the camera for a specific shooting situation (like "landscape", "portrait", ...), and later have a quick access to that configuration.

Up to 5 presets can be stored on the card. To store a preset, press `DP` while in [UserGuide#The_menu the 400plus menu]; then select a slot and press `SET` (if a slot has been previously used, its content get overwritten). To recover a preset, press `DP` while in [UserGuide#The_shortcuts_menu the shortcuts menu]; then select a preset and press `SET` (if a slot is empty, nothing happens).

*NOTE*: When a preset is recovered, all camera parameters get changed, even the AE mode; notice that the camera may operate in an AE mode different from the AE mode currently selected in the main dial.

= The AF-Pattern selection =

Press the `ZOOM IN` button to enter the _standard_ "AF-Point selection" dialog; then press `ZOOM IN` again to enter the new "AF-Pattern selection" dialog. Use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `SET` buttons to move around the patterns, then half-press the shutter button to exit the dialog.

= The goodies =

The following _goodies_ have been added to the camera.

== In the basic zone ==

In the _basic zone_, use the `AV` button to toggle between `RAW` and `JPEG` output.

== In the creative zone ==

In the _creative zone_ the following goodies are active:
 * In the ISO selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set ISO 3200 (see [UserGuide#Extended_ISOs Notes / Extended ISOs]).
 * In the metering mode selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set spot metering (see [UserGuide#Spot_metering_mode Notes / Spot metering mode]).
 * In the white balance selection dialog, press `DIRECT PRINT` to set the user-defined color temperature.

= Other freebies =

Other changes to the camera behavior, not described above.

== Extended info ==

In the "camera settings" screen (press `DISP` at the _standard_ camera menu), the last line now displays the following information (instead of the card's free space):
 * The total number of shots made by this camera.
 * The version number of 400plus currently installed.
 * The "BodyID" (an internal number, unique to each camera).

Use `SET` and `LEFT` / `RIGHT` to change the value displayed.

== The nose affair ==

While looking through the viewfinder, the `ISO` and `WB` buttons are no longer active, to prevent accidental changes with the user's nose.

== Factory menu and debug mode ==

*WARNING*: These options should be used with great care, there is probably little to see here, unless you are developing your own hack.

From the 400plus menu, go down to the "Developers menu" entry and press `SET`:

 * _*Enter factory mode*_: Puts the camera into "factory mode"; also activates the "factory menu".
 * _*Leave factory mode*_: Puts the camera back into "normal mode".
 * _*Start debug mode*_: The camera will store lots of debugging information to the card, in two files called `STDOUT.TXT` and `STDERR.TXT`..

*NOTE*:Remember to leave the "factory mode" before using the camera, as photographs cannot be downloaded to a computer while the camera is in that mode.

= Notes =

Some notes and comments.

== Extended ISOs ==

_Non-standard_ ISO values are software-only, and technically produce zero gain over shooting at the _base_ ISO and later post-processing the image; this includes ISO-3200.

== Spot metering mode ==

The spot metering mode is like the _standard_ "partial metering" mode, but the area included in the metering is smaller.

= Known bugs =

The following relevant bugs have been reported and confirmed:

 * Issue #15: Exposure changes during EAEB.
 * Issue #38: Presets: Wrong AE mode restored during power-up.
