== What is 400plus? ==

*400plus* is a free firmware enhancement software which offers additional functionality and capabilities to your Canon 400D/XTi camera in both a non-destructive, and non-permanent way. It works by loading into your camera's memory automatically upon boot-up to enhance the native camera firmware but is not a permanent firmware upgrade and can easily be removed. It is designed specifically for the Canon 400D/XTi and will not work with other camera models.

== User guide ==

This wiki page document will serve as the user guide for 400plus. It is assumed in this document that the user has installed 400plus prior to reading this guide and that it is working properly. For information about installing 400plus, please see [FirmwareHackInstallation].

= The menu =

== Accessing the menu ==

To access the 400plus menu, press the `DP` button from the main camera dialog. To exit the 400plus menu, just half-press the shutter release button. _NOTE_: The `DP` button is located on the rear of the camera at the left of the viewfinder (beside the blue printer icon with the squiggly arrow line next to it).

== Navigating the menu ==

400plus features a multi-page menu, where each page is dedicated to a certain task. To navigate the pages, use the front wheel or the `ZOOM IN` / `ZOOM OUT` buttons (notice the `<<` and `>>` at the header). There is also a method to quickly access any page: press and hold the `AV` button down, then a list of all available pages will appear; now use the front dial to select a page, and release the `AV` button to jump into it.

To navigate within a page, use the `UP` (`ISO`) and `DOWN` (`WB`) buttons; then use the `LEFT` (`METERING`) and `RIGHT` (`AF`) buttons to change the value of the selected item (press and hold these buttons to change faster). Items with an exclamation mark '`!`' at the left perform an action; activate them with the `SET` button. And Items with a right sign '`>`' are sub-menus; enter them with the `RIGHT` button, and return back to the main page with the `AV` button. Notice that some items can both perform an action and have a sub-menu.

== Configuring the menu ==

While in any page within the menu, you have the ability to change the order of the items for your own personal preference. To do this, just press the `PLAY` button to "grab" an item (a small ">" will be displayed at the left of the item). Now use the `UP` or `DOWN` buttons to position the menu item where you would like it to reside (you will see the menu item move to a new position). Finish the process by pressing the `PLAY` button again to save your changes.

 * _*Config. Pages*_: Use this sub-menu to configure the order how the pages must be displayed.

=== Presets Page ===

Use this page to load, save, and rename [#The_presets presets]; the procedure to rename a preset is :

 * Select the "Rename" option in the presets sub-menu.
 * Use `UP` / `DOWN` / `LEFT` / `RIGHT` buttons to select a value.
 * Use the `MENU` button to toggle between lowercase / numbers and uppercase / symbols.
 * Use the `JUMP` button to change the case of the selected value on the name (bottom line).
 * Use the `SET` button to use the selected value in the name and advance the cursor to the next position.
 * Use the front (main) dial or the `ZOOM IN` / `ZOOM OUT` buttons to move the cursor within the preset name line (bottom line).
 * Press the `AV` button again to save your changes and return to the previous menu.

Notice that there is always a number displayed on the left of each preset. This feature is handy when you want to copy presets to and from multiple CF cards and need to know the file names for each of your presets: the number on the left of a feature matches the number of the file created in the CF card.

=== Developers Page ===

*NOTE*: The developers page is disabled by default, and must be enabled in the [#Settings_Page settings page] prior to accessing it; moreover, the developers' page lays outside the normal page navigation: press the `TRASH` button, while in the menu, to enter the developers' page.

_This Page Is Intentionally Left Blank._

*WARNING*: The options contained in this page should be used with great care, there is probably little to see here, unless you are developing your own hack.

= The scripts =

When a script starts or stops, a _beep_ will be heard; and while a script is running, the `DP` button will flash (approx. twice per second). To stop a running script, press the `DP` button again; sometimes the camera may not stop immediately, so hold the `DP` button until you hear a _beep_ that signals the effective end of the script.

All scripts will check the card capacity before each shot; if the estimated number of shots available is lower than a fixed value (3), the scripts will stop executing.

== Extended AEB ==

This script performs the same task as the _standard_ AEB option from the camera, but with a few nice enhancements:
 * Up to 9 shots may be specified.
 * The separation between shots is configurable up to +-6 EV.
 * The camera will take all the shots in a sequence, automatically.
 * User can specify the _direction_ of the sequence.

Supposing a configuration of 5 shots at 1EV separation, this is how each _direction_ is supposed to work:
 * `+/-` : One photo at current EV, and the rest above and below it: 0EV, +1EV, -1EV, +2EV, -2EV.
 * ` + ` : One photo at current EV, and the rest above it: 0EV, +1EV, +2EV, +3EV, +4EV.
 * ` - ` : One photo at current EV, and the rest below it: 0EV, -1EV, -2EV, -3EV, -4EV.

In 'M' mode with the aperture value set to `BULB`, this script will fire the camera as many times as needed (in this mode, the number of shots configured is irrelevant), with shutter speeds ranging from the "Bulb min:" value to the "Bulb max:" value, separating each shot by the "Step (EV)" value. Notice also that exposure times as long as 32 minutes can be used in this mode.

== Flash AEB ==

Similar to the [#Extended_AEB Extended AEB] script, but only the flash exposure compensation will change.

== ISO AEB ==

Camera will make a photograph for each ISO configured.

You probably want to set the camera to `M` mode prior to using this script.

== Intervalometer ==

This script will fire the camera as many times as configured (or endlessly), with a configurable delay between shots; use this script to create _stop-motion_ movies, for example.

=== Strict scheduling ===

Notice that `400plus` will always try to maintain a constant cadence of shots, independent of the exposure time: if configured to shot at 15s intervals, for example, then one shot will be taken exactly every 15s, even if the exposure is 10s. If one shot in the sequence has an exposure time longer than the configured interval time, `400plus` will skip as many shots as needed and reschedule the sequence accordingly. This comment is also true when the intervalometer is configured to fire any multi-shot action.

For example, imagine an interval of 5 seconds, and exposures ranging between 1 and 4 seconds (let's suppose camera is in Av mode, and light conditions change during the script):

{{{
Time (s) : # · · · · # · · · · # · · · · # · · · ·
Exposure : * *       * * * *   *         * *
}}}

Notice how the length of pause between the end of an exposure and the beginning of the next one adapts to the exposure time, so photographs always start at regular intervals. Now, imagine that one of the exposures takes longer than 5 seconds (let's say 7):

{{{
Time (s) : # · · · · # · · · · # · · · · # · · · ·
Exposure : * *       * * * * * * *       * *
}}}

Notice that the third photograph does not take place 5 seconds after the second one, but at second 15.

=== Time-lapse calculator ===

If you plan to make a time-lapse movie with the photographs taken with this script, you can specify a desired reproduction frame-rate, and the script will calculate the resulting reproduction time. These parameters are purely informative, and have no influence on the script.

== Hand Waving ==

This script will fire the camera when the display-off sensor (at the rear of the camera) is triggered. Use this script to fire the camera without the need of a remote to help reduce camera shake. If the "Repeat" option is active, this script will not end after being triggered, but will repeat itself again so you can take more shots. By default, this script will wait until something (like your hand or finger) blocks the sensor and is then removed to fire the camera. However, if the "Instant" option is enabled, the script will fire the camera as soon as the sensor becomes blocked.

== Self Timer ==

This script simply adds a configurable pause before firing the camera.

== Long Exposure ==

Just that, a configurable long exposure, from 15 seconds to 100 minutes.

Notice that the camera has to be in M + BULB mode to take a long exposure; this script will set the camera for you, but configuring a suitable aperture is the responsibility of the user.

=== Long Exposure Calculator ===

The long exposure calculator is a tool created to help the photographer quickly determine the exposure time required by a particular scene. The idea behind the long exposure calculator is that you can quickly measure a scene using a high ISO and a large aperture, then lower the ISO value and reduce the aperture, but increase the exposure time accordingly.

For example, let's suppose we want to photograph a night scene; we decide to use the lowest possible sensitivity (ISO100), to avoid noise, and a relatively closed aperture (f/8), to get the depth of field we need. Using those parameters, the exposure time needed may easily overpass 30 seconds, and thus we cannot use the camera to make a reliable measurement.

But we can temporarily select a high sensitivity and large aperture (ISO1600 and f/2.8, for example), measure the scene, and determine we would need a 15-second exposure with those parameters. Then we enter the long exposure calculator, lower the ISO value to 100, and close the diaphragm to f/8; the Ev indicator will display a value if -9, meaning that with the current parameters the exposure is 9 stops below the measured value. We can now increase the exposition time until the Ev indicator goes back to 0, meaning the current parameters would result in the same exposure than we had at the beginning; in our case, that means raising the exposure time from 15 seconds to 32 minutes. Finally, just press "Apply" to configure the camera with these parameters, and launch the long exposure script.

NOTE: The long exposure calculator will only apply the values presented on the display when the exposure time (Tv) is one minute or longer; for shorter exposure times, the "Apply" button will simply be inactive.

TIP: If you plan to use a ND filter, you can measure the scene without the ND; then enter the long exposure calculator and adjust the exposure to get an Ev result inverse to the value of the ND filter. For example, assuming we have an ND8 filter (8 steps of light reduction): if the camera measures 1/120s f/4.0 ISO1600 without the filter, then select 2' f/8.0 ISO100 to achieve a Ev of +8.

=== DOF Calculator ===

The DOF Calculator can help determine the depth of field of a scene, or the range of distances that will be photographed as sharp; for more information about this concept, please visit [http://www.dofmaster.com/index.html DOF Master].

After entering the DOF Calculator, set the focal length of your lens, the aperture you are using, and the distance from the camera to the subject. The script will then display the near and far distances of acceptable sharpness. You can now change the aperture and / or the focusing distance until the depth of field displayed matches the part of your scene that you deem as important and want to remain in-focus.

When the "Max. DOF (m)" entry displays "INF!", the hyperfocal distance has been reached, and thus everything from the near distance of acceptable focus up to the infinity will be sharp.

= The presets =

A "preset" is a complete snapshot containing all of the camera settings and configuration parameters. Presets can be used to pre-configure the camera for a specific shooting situation (like "landscape", "portrait", "low-light", "birds-in-flight", etc.), and allow you to have quick access to these configurations while shooting. Presets are stored on the CF card itself. Up to 9 presets can be stored. The number of presets however is unlimited due to the fact you may use multiple CF cards each containing up to 9 presets.

== The A-DEP mode ==

Under normal circumstances, when a preset is loaded (recovered) all camera parameters are changed, even the AE mode. Take notice that the camera may then operate in an AE mode which is different from the AE mode currently selected with the mode dial. Yet when the camera is powered off and back on, it will revert to the actual AE mode that the mode dial is set to.

To solve this issue, there is an option to hijack the (mostly unused) A-DEP mode; when this option is active, the following changes will take place:
 * Presets can only be loaded when the camera is in A-DEP mode. Envision the word "Presets" instead of "A-DEP" on the mode dial.
 * When the camera is powered on in A-DEP mode, or when the user moves the mode dial to the A-DEP position, the last preset used is automatically loaded (recalled).

When this option is not enabled, then when the A-DEP position is selected with the mode dial the camera will use the A-DEP mode as it normally would.

= AutoISO =

`400plus` has support for AutoISO in creative modes, using our own algorithms. It works by reading the measurements that the camera makes, when you half-press the shutter button, and changing the ISO value acordingly. The behaviour of AutoISO is different for each creative mode, but the idea is roughtly the same: use the lowest possible ISO to maintain a suitable speed or aperture.

To enable AutoISO for the creative modes, activate it at the settings menu, or pres `DP` at the ISO selection dialog; to disable it, use the settings menu or select any ISO value at the ISO selection dialog.

== AutoISO and Av mode ==

The intention of AutoISO in Av mode is to use the lowest possible ISO that ensures no motion blur.

In _normal_ Av mode, the user selects ISO and aperture, and the camera decides the shutter speed according to the scene. But when AutoISO is active, `400plus` will always try to use the lowest possible ISO value (as configured by "Min ISO"), unless the shutter speed gets too low (as configured by "Min Tv"); when that happens, `400plus` will authomaticaly raise the ISO value (up to "Max ISO") as needed.

Please, note that when both Safety Shift and AutoISO are enabled, the camera could drop shutter speed below the configured "Min Tv", if "Max ISO" is reached, in order to maintain a correct exposure.

== AutoISO and Tv mode ==

In Tv mode, the intention of AutoISO is to use the lowest possible ISO that ensures an acceptable depth of field.

In Tv mode, AutoISO will try to keep ISO as low as possible (as configured by "Min ISO"), unless the scene requires an apperture larger than desired (as configured at "Max Av"); then, AutoISO will raise the ISO value (up to "Max ISO") as needed.

Please, note that you must set "Max Av" at most just above the maximum aperture of the lens that you're using. For example, if your lens is f/4, "Max Av" should be set no lower than f/5.6; take into account that zoom lenses can have different maximum apertures, depending on the focal length you are using. Otherwise, AutoISO will not function properly in Tv mode. Also, the comment about Safety Shif and AutoISO at Av mode applies at Tv mode, too.

== AutoISO and P mode ==

In P mode, AutoISO _tries_ to behave just like in Av mode, and raises the ISO value to keep a minimum shutter speed; but, as the camera decides both aperture and shutter speed in this mode, there is no guarantee that raising the ISO will increase shutter speed: it tends to work correctly for small values of "Min Tv", but for larger values the camera usually decides to close the diaphragm instead of selecting a faster shutter speed.

== AutoISO and M mode ==

In M mode, the behavior of AutoISO is completely different to other modes: in this case, the user selects both the aperture and the shutter speed, and `400plus` will set the exact ISO to match the scene. None of the configuration parameters affect AutoISO in M mode, and this is the only mode where intermediate ISO values are used.

To change the exposure compensation in M mode, use the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` keys while looking through the viewfinder.

= ISO in viewfinder =

When this option is active (set to Yes), and if the camera is set in any creative mode, you can change the ISO value while looking through the viewfinder; on Tv and M mode, the new ISO value is also displayed on the viewfinder:

 * Set the camera to M or Tv mode.
 * Look through the viewfinder, and half-press the shutter button; you should see the current measurement (shutter speed, aperture, ...).
 * Now press the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` buttons to change the ISO value (or UP just to display it); the new value is displayed in the viewfinder, in the same place where shutter speed is normally shown, while the button is pressed down.
 * In P and Av modes, ISO can also be changed, but it is not displayed.

= The AF-Pattern point selection =

400plus offers a range of additional AF-Pattern point selections instead of just the two (Manual AF point selection, Automatic selection) which are included standard in the camera. These additional AF-pattern point selections provide a wide range of multi-point selection patterns using different combinations of the 9 focus points for some creative AF capabilities.

To use the additional AF-Pattern point selections during shooting, press the `ZOOM IN` button to enter the _standard_ "AF-Point selection" dialog, then press the `ZOOM IN` button again to enter the new "AF-Pattern selection" dialog. Use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `SET` buttons to move around the different AF selection patterns available. Half-press the shutter release button to exit the dialog.

= The goodies =

The following *_goodies_* have been added to the camera to enhance its capabilities.

== In the basic zone ==

  * Use the `AV` button to toggle between image quality settings `JPEG`, `RAW`, and `JPEG+RAW`. Notice that quality and size are changed to "HIGH+L" each time this option is used.

== In the creative zone ==

  * In the ISO selection dialog, press `DP` to activate [#AutoISO AutoISO]; select any ISO value to deactivate it.
  * In the Metering mode selection dialog, press `DP` to set Spot metering (see [#Spot_metering_mode Notes / Spot metering mode]).
  * In the White balance selection dialog, press `DP` to set the user-defined white balance kelvin temperature.

= Other freebies =

Other changes to the camera behavior, not described above.

== The nose affair ==

While looking through the viewfinder, the `ISO` and `WB` buttons become inactive. This is done to prevent accidental changes to camera settings from pressing your nose (or cheek) up against the camera body.

== Multi-language support ==

Currently 400plus supports nine (9) languages:

  * English
  * Finnish
  * French
  * German
  * Italian
  * Polish
  * Russian
  * Simplified Chinese
  * Spanish

The desire is to have 400plus be supported in as many languages as possible! If you are interested in assisting in the conversion of 400plus to a different language, we would certainly welcome your efforts. Let us know by making a request via the forum!

= Notes =

Some notes and comments.

== The _missing_ ISO-3200 ==

Previous versions of `400plus` supported ISO-3200; or more precisely, it _appeared_ to support it: while the camera displayed "3200" as the ISO value, images where actually being shot at ISO-3000. Latests versions of `400plus` correct this bug, and thus only values up to ISO-3000 are supported now.

Note, thus, that _an image shot at the new ISO-3000 will be exactly the same as if shot with the old ISO-3200_.

== Extended ISOs ==

_Non-standard_ ISO values are software-only calculated values, and technically offer little to no gain over shooting at the standard _base_ ISO values and later post-processing the image. They can be useful, however, when there is no time for any post-processing.

Please, notice that the camera will not always display the correct ISO value; for example, an image shot at ISO-3000 will show as ISO-3200 during the review.

== Spot metering mode ==

The spot metering mode is similar to the _standard_ "partial metering" mode, but the area included in the metering is smaller (approx. 3.5% of the center of the viewfinder vs. partial metering at approx. 9% of the center of the viewfinder). It works quite well when needed.

= Known bugs =

The following relevant bugs have been reported and confirmed:

 * Issue #156: Auto-focus Assist Beam not fired from 430EX when using extended AF patterns.
 * Issue #153: Standard menu flashes before shortcuts menu.
