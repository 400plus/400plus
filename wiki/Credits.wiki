===Some notes (*0xAF*)===
  I've tried to narrow down the all ppl who worked on this hack from the beginning,
  if i've missed someone, please let me know.
  
  This hack was developed by many ppl from it's very beginning,
  and it was developed in separate versions...

  I guess this is the way the hard-core hackers are working (mostly alone),
  but I'm so grateful that Eduperez rewrited the code from the scratch.

  He made it easier for new developers to join the project and we have
  one hack in the end !
